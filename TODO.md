# TODO

- When scanning, teammates will show up. Bot should not treat them as enemies. AND, avoid firing at them, e.g., when
  seeing an enemy behind them.
- Teammates will take damage when they are hit by your bot (friendly fire).

# FAQ

- Make sure we cover all these in the end: https://robowiki.net/wiki/Robocode/FAQ

# Future

- We might be able to enable/disable friendly fire. Perhaps wait for the community to ask for it?

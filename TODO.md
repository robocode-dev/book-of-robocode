# TODO

# Images (request from AI)

- Consider gradually converting key conceptual diagrams from PNG to SVG or Mermaid where practical:
  - `book/images/my-first-bot-config.png`
- Decide whether any non-screenshot/non-historical PNG images should be regenerated (or re-exported) to better match
  the book’s visual style and new SVG/Mermaid preference.

# In the end

- We need to links on terms like `GuessFactor`
- How to people contribute?
- Links to the book of Robocode -> make PR? How to file/correct an issue?
- Update ATTRIBUTION.md and also a page in the book with credits to _all_ the people behind the pages.

# FAQ

- Make sure we cover all these in the end: https://robowiki.net/wiki/Robocode/FAQ

# Future

- We might be able to enable/disable friendly fire. Perhaps wait for the community to ask for it?

# IMPORTANT!

- Add links to the book of in both Robocode and Tank Royale:
  - in About dialog AND Help menu
- Contact Julian Kent ("Skilgannon") with link to Book of Robocode (add to RoboWiki?)

- Refactor all documents of robocode.dev to use the book of Robocode as a reference.

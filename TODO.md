# TODO

- When scanning, teammates will show up. Bot should not treat them as enemies. AND, avoid firing at them, e.g., when
  seeing an enemy behind them.
- Teammates will take damage when they are hit by your bot (friendly fire).

- Consider gradually converting key conceptual diagrams from PNG to SVG or Mermaid where practical:
  - `docs/images/bot-lifecycle.png`
  - `docs/images/classic-vs-tank-royale.png`
  - `docs/images/my-first-bot-config.png`
- Decide whether any non-screenshot/non-historical PNG images should be regenerated (or re-exported) to better match
  the book’s visual style and new SVG/Mermaid preference.

- Make sure we cover all these in the end: https://robowiki.net/wiki/Robocode/FAQ

# Future

- We might be able to enable/disable friendly fire. Perhaps wait for the community to ask for it?

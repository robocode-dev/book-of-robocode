# Images (request from AI)

- Consider gradually converting key conceptual diagrams from PNG to SVG or Mermaid where practical:
  - `book/images/classic-vs-tank-royale.png`
  - `book/images/my-first-bot-config.png`
- Decide whether any non-screenshot/non-historical PNG images should be regenerated (or re-exported) to better match
  the book’s visual style and new SVG/Mermaid preference.

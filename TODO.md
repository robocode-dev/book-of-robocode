## Missing Crucial Pages for First Version

### High Priority (Core Concepts)
| Section | Page | Why Crucial |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Radar & Scanning | **Melee Radar** (all sub-pages) | Incomplete radar coverage |
| Targeting Systems | **Introducing Waves** | Foundation for all advanced targeting |
| Targeting Systems | **GuessFactor Targeting** | Most important intermediate targeting concept |
| Movement & Evasion | **Anti-Gravity Movement** | Key strategic movement pattern |
| Movement & Evasion | **Wave Surfing Introduction** | Essential advanced evasion technique |
| Appendices | **Quick Reference (Formulas)** | Practical reference users will need |

### Medium Priority (Completeness)
- **The Targeting Problem → Introducing Waves** — bridges simple to statistical targeting
- **Precise Prediction** — enables accurate future position calculation
- **Pattern Matching** — fundamental log-based targeting

### Suggested Minimum for V1
Complete at least: **Waves**, **GuessFactor Targeting**, **Anti-Gravity Movement**, and **Quick Reference**.

# Images (request from AI)

- Consider gradually converting key conceptual diagrams from PNG to SVG or Mermaid where practical:
  - `book/images/my-first-bot-config.png`
- Decide whether any non-screenshot/non-historical PNG images should be regenerated (or re-exported) to better match
  the book’s visual style and new SVG/Mermaid preference.

# In the end

- We need to links on terms like `GuessFactor`
- How to people contribute?
- Links to the book of Robocode -> make PR? How to file/correct an issue?
- Update ATTRIBUTION.md and also a page in the book with credits to _all_ the people behind the pages.

**Wall of Fame Options (page created at `book/appendices/wall-of-fame.md`):**
- Use inline `::: tip Origins` callouts on pages where specific people invented/refined techniques
- Add optional `credits` frontmatter field to `specs/page-generation-spec.md`

# FAQ

- Make sure we cover all these in the end: https://robowiki.net/wiki/Robocode/FAQ

# Future

- We might be able to enable/disable friendly fire. Perhaps wait for the community to ask for it?

# IMPORTANT!

- Add links to the book of in both Robocode and Tank Royale:
  - in About dialog AND Help menu
- Contact Julian Kent ("Skilgannon") with link to Book of Robocode (add to RoboWiki?)

- Refactor all documents of robocode.dev to use the book of Robocode as a reference.

# What is Robocode?

## Introduction

**Robocode** is a [programming game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_game) where the goal is to code a robot battle tank (bot). The bot must compete against other tanks in a virtual battle arena.

The "player" of the game is the programmer (coder) of the bot, who has no direct influence on the game while it is running. Instead, the player must write a program that makes up the brain of the tank. The program tells how the tank must behave and react to events occurring in the battle arena.

## How It Works

Your code controls:
- **Movement** - Navigate the battlefield and avoid enemy fire
- **Radar** - Scan for enemy tanks
- **Gun** - Aim and fire at opponents
- **Strategy** - React to events and make tactical decisions

All bots get a score and placement based on their performance. The aim is to achieve the highest score possible.

## Purpose

Robocode is designed to help you:
- **Learn programming** in a fun, interactive way
- **Improve coding skills** through practical challenges
- **Study AI** in a fast-running real-time game environment
- **Compete** with other programmers worldwide

## Two Versions

### Classic Robocode
The original version, Java-based, that started it all in 2001. Available at [robocode.sourceforge.io](https://robocode.sourceforge.io/)

### Robocode Tank Royale
A modern reimplementation supporting multiple programming languages:
- Java
- C#
- Python
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- Kotlin
- And more...

## The Name "Robocode"

The name _Robocode_ is short for "Robot code" from the original version. In Tank Royale, the term "bot" is used instead of "robot."

## The Name "Tank Royale"

Robocode's battles take place on a battlefield where small automated tank bots fight until only one is left - like a Battle Royale game. Hence, the name _Tank Royale_.

::: tip Note
Robocode contains no gore, no blood, no people, and no politics. The battles are simply for the excitement of competition and learning.

## Example Battle

In a typical Robocode battle, you'll see:
- Tanks moving around the arena
- Radars spinning to detect enemies
- Bullets flying across the battlefield
- Energy levels changing as tanks take damage
- Scoring updating in real-time

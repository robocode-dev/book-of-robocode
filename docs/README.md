> “May your aim be true and your dodges unpredictable.” — Adopted Robocoding Motto

**Robocode** is a programming game where you code a robot battle tank to compete against other tanks in a virtual arena. The goal is to write code that makes your tank move, scan for enemies, and fire at opponents autonomously.

This documentation covers both:
- **Classic Robocode** - The original Java-based version
- **Robocode Tank Royale** - The modern, multilanguage version

## Quick Start

1. [Read the Introduction](./introduction/what-is-robocode) to understand what Robocode is
2. [Follow the Tutorial](./getting-started/your-first-bot) to create your first bot
3. [Learn the Physics](./articles/physics) to master game mechanics
4. [Understand Scoring](./articles/scoring) to optimize your strategy

## Community & Credits

This documentation draws upon the collective knowledge of the Robocode community, with special thanks to the contributors of [RoboWiki](http://robowiki.net/) for their extensive research and documentation over the years.

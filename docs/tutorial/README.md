# Tutorial

Welcome to the Robocode tutorial section! Here you'll learn how to create and program your own battle tanks.

## Tutorial Path

Follow these tutorials in order to learn Robocode from scratch:

1. [Getting Started](/tutorial/getting-started) - Set up your development environment
2. [My First Bot](/tutorial/my-first-bot) - Create your first working bot
3. [Beyond the Basics](/tutorial/beyond-basics) - Advanced techniques and strategies

## What You'll Learn

- How to set up Robocode on your computer
- Basic bot structure and API
- Movement and navigation
- Radar scanning and targeting
- Shooting and combat strategies
- Advanced techniques and optimizations

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge in at least one language (Java, Python, C#, JavaScript, etc.)
- Understanding of basic mathematics (geometry, trigonometry helpful but not required)
- A computer with a development environment for your chosen language

## Choose Your Path

### Classic Robocode (Java)
If you want to use the original Robocode with Java, you'll work with the Java API and established community.

### Tank Royale (Multiple Languages)
If you prefer modern tools and want to use Python, C#, JavaScript, or other languages, Tank Royale is the way to go.

Both versions share the same core physics and game mechanics, so the concepts you learn apply to both!

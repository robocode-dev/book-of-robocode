# Wall of Fame

Robocode's rich strategic depth exists because of dedicated community members who spent years developing, documenting,
and sharing their discoveries. This page honors those who shaped the game's competitive landscape.

## The Pioneers

### Peter Strömberg (PEZ)

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:PEZ)  
Founder and original administrator of the [RoboWiki](https://robowiki.net/). Creator of legendary bots
**[CassiusClay](https://robowiki.net/wiki/CassiusClay)** and **[Pugilist](https://robowiki.net/wiki/Pugilist)**. 
Through his bot **GFTargetingBot** and his work on the RoboWiki, PEZ provided clear, simplified examples of how to 
combine Waves (to collect data) with GuessFactor statistics, helping to popularize the technique. PEZ was instrumental 
in building the collaborative community culture and co-founded the wiki with Crippa in January 2003.

### Crippa

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:Crippa)  
Co-founder of the RoboWiki. In January 2003, Crippa and PEZ created the wiki as a private site before opening it to the
public to serve as the community's central knowledge hub.

### Julian Kent (Skilgannon)

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:Skilgannon)  
Author of **[DrussGT](https://robowiki.net/wiki/DrussGT)**, one of the most dominant bots in history. Skilgannon
advanced **Dynamic Clustering** and melee strategies. He is the primary administrator and developer of the modern *
*[LiteRumble](https://robowiki.net/wiki/LiteRumble)** ranking system.

### Paul Evans

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:Paul_Evans)

Creator of **[SandboxDT](https://robowiki.net/wiki/SandboxDT)**. Paul Evans is most frequently cited as the primary 
inventor of **[GuessFactor Targeting](https://robowiki.net/wiki/GuessFactor_Targeting)**, the statistical targeting 
approach that revolutionized competitive Robocode. Along with David Alves and Albert Perez, he pioneered the technique 
in the early 2000s that remains the foundation of high-level competitive play today.

### Patrick Cupka (Voidious)

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:Voidious)  
Author of **[Dookious](https://robowiki.net/wiki/Dookious)**. Voidious is credited with refining **Wave Surfing** and
movement flattening to a science. He took over RoboWiki management in 2007 and wrote many of the community's definitive
strategy guides.

### Albert Perez

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:Albert)  
Creator of the original **[RoboRumble](https://robowiki.net/wiki/RoboRumble)** client. This continuous, distributed
ranking system transformed Robocode into a true competitive sport by providing a massive, live testing ground for every
bot created. Albert also co-pioneered **GuessFactor Targeting** by contributing FuturePosition code, which allowed bots 
to accurately predict the results of various movement choices—a critical component for the "precise prediction" required 
to make GuessFactor Targeting effective.

### David Alves

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:David_Alves)  
Author of **[Phoenix](https://robowiki.net/wiki/Phoenix)** and **[Falcon](https://robowiki.net/wiki/Falcon)**. David 
Alves was one of the co-pioneers of **GuessFactor Targeting** alongside Paul Evans and Albert Perez. In early 2003, he 
shared significant descriptions of how the system works—tracking maximum escape angles and "bins" of movement—which 
helped formalize the concept for the community. His analytical breakdowns helped the community move from "magic numbers" 
to mathematically sound bot logic through **[Pattern Matching](https://robowiki.net/wiki/Pattern_Matching)** and 
precise physics prediction.

## Documentation & Innovation

### ABC

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:Abc)  
Inventor of **[Wave Surfing](https://robowiki.net/wiki/Wave_Surfing)**, the most significant defensive discovery in
Robocode history. Author of **[Shadow](https://robowiki.net/wiki/Shadow)**, which also introduced sophisticated melee
gun techniques.

### Simonton

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:Simonton)  
Author of **[Diamond](https://robowiki.net/wiki/Diamond)**. Simonton pushed **Dynamic Clustering** to its limits,
proving that highly segmented statistical data could achieve near-perfect accuracy against diverse opponents.

### Rednaxela

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:Rednaxela)  
Introduced the use of **[K-D Trees](https://robowiki.net/wiki/K-D_Tree)** to Robocode. This optimization allowed bots to
search massive amounts of historical data instantly, making advanced clustering algorithms computationally viable.

### Kawigi

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:Kawigi)

Often called the "Great Educator" of Robocode, Kawigi wrote the definitive **GuessFactor Targeting Tutorial** that 
taught most of the community how to build their own GuessFactor guns. He authored **[FloodMini](https://robowiki.net/wiki/FloodMini)**, 
one of the first successful open-source bots to use the technique. Because Paul Evans' bots were often closed-source, 
Kawigi's open implementation is what actually made GuessFactor Targeting accessible to the broader community. His 
beginner-friendly explanations and tools (like **KawigiEdit**) helped bridge the gap for thousands of new programmers 
entering the scene.

### MultiplyByZer0

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:MultiplyByZer0)

Active wiki editor who documented targeting strategies, wave mechanics, and provided numerous code samples. Helped
maintain and expand RoboWiki's coverage of intermediate and advanced topics.

## The Creator

### Mathew A. Nelson (Mat Nelson)

The original creator of Robocode at IBM in 2001. His vision of "learning through battle" started the entire phenomenon.

### Flemming N. Larsen (fnl)

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:Fnl)  
The long-time maintainer of the classic Robocode project and the creator of **Robocode Tank Royale**. Flemming has kept
the game alive and evolving for over two decades.

# Wall of Fame

Robocode's rich strategic depth exists because of dedicated community members who spent years developing, documenting,
and sharing their discoveries. This page honors those who shaped the game's competitive landscape.

## The Pioneers

### Peter Strömberg (PEZ)

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:PEZ)  
Founder and original administrator of the [RoboWiki](https://robowiki.net/). Creator of legendary bots
**[CassiusClay](https://robowiki.net/wiki/CassiusClay)** and **[Pugilist](https://robowiki.net/wiki/Pugilist)**. PEZ was
instrumental in building the collaborative community culture and co-founded the wiki with Crippa in January 2003.

### Crippa

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:Crippa)  
Co-founder of the RoboWiki. In January 2003, Crippa and PEZ created the wiki as a private site before opening it to the
public to serve as the community's central knowledge hub.

### Julian Kent (Skilgannon)

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:Skilgannon)  
Author of **[DrussGT](https://robowiki.net/wiki/DrussGT)**, one of the most dominant bots in history. Skilgannon
advanced **Dynamic Clustering** and melee strategies. He is the primary administrator and developer of the modern
**[LiteRumble](https://robowiki.net/wiki/LiteRumble)** ranking system.

### Paul Evans

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:Paul_Evans)  
Creator of **[SandboxDT](https://robowiki.net/wiki/SandboxDT)**. Paul Evans is a co-pioneer of
**[GuessFactor Targeting](https://robowiki.net/wiki/GuessFactor_Targeting)**. His work in the early 2000s set the
standard for statistical targeting that remains the foundation of high-level competitive play today.

### David Alves

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:David_Alves)  
Author of **[Phoenix](https://robowiki.net/wiki/Phoenix)** and **[Falcon](https://robowiki.net/wiki/Falcon)**. Along
with Paul Evans, David is credited as a co-pioneer of
**[GuessFactor Targeting](https://robowiki.net/wiki/GuessFactor_Targeting)**,
providing the first formalized descriptions of the "bin" and "wave" systems. He is also a primary architect of
**[Pattern Matching](https://robowiki.net/wiki/Pattern_Matching)**, which he used in
**[Phoenix](https://robowiki.net/wiki/Phoenix)**
to create the first dominant high-level targeting strategy. Pattern Matching remains a valid alternative to
**[GuessFactor Targeting](https://robowiki.net/wiki/GuessFactor_Targeting)** in specific scenarios, particularly
against bots with repetitive movement patterns.

### Patrick Cupka (Voidious)

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:Voidious)  
Author of **[Dookious](https://robowiki.net/wiki/Dookious)**. Voidious is credited with refining **Wave Surfing** and
movement flattening to a science. He took over RoboWiki management in 2007 and wrote many of the community's definitive
strategy guides.

### Albert Perez

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:Albert)  
Creator of the original **[RoboRumble](https://robowiki.net/wiki/RoboRumble)** client and contributor of the
**FuturePosition** code. This distributed ranking system transformed Robocode into a true competitive sport by providing
a massive, live testing ground for every bot created.

### Kawigi

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:Kawigi)  
The community's "Great Educator." Kawigi wrote the definitive **GuessFactor Targeting Tutorial** and authored
**FloodMini**, the first successful open-source implementation of GuessFactors, which allowed the wider community to
adopt the technique.

## Bot Innovators

### ABC

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:Abc)  
Inventor of **[Wave Surfing](https://robowiki.net/wiki/Wave_Surfing)**, the most significant defensive discovery in
Robocode history. Author of **[Shadow](https://robowiki.net/wiki/Shadow)**, which introduced sophisticated melee gun
techniques and multi-target engagement.

### Simonton

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:Simonton)  
Author of **[Diamond](https://robowiki.net/wiki/Diamond)**. Simonton pushed **Dynamic Clustering** to its limits,
proving that highly segmented statistical data could achieve near-perfect accuracy against diverse opponents.

### Rednaxela

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:Rednaxela)  
Introduced the use of **[K-D Trees](https://robowiki.net/wiki/K-D_Tree)** to Robocode. This optimization allowed bots to
search massive amounts of historical data instantly, making advanced clustering algorithms computationally viable for
real-time play.

### MultiplyByZer0

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:MultiplyByZer0)

Active wiki editor who documented targeting strategies, wave mechanics, and provided many code samples. Helped
maintain and expand RoboWiki's coverage of intermediate and advanced topics.

## The Creator

### Mathew A. Nelson (Mat Nelson)

The original creator of Robocode at IBM in 2001. His vision of "learning through battle" started the entire phenomenon.

### Flemming N. Larsen (fnl)

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:Fnl)  
The long-time maintainer of the classic Robocode project and the creator of **Robocode Tank Royale**. Flemming has kept
the game alive and evolving for over two decades.

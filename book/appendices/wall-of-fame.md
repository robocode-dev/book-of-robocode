# Wall of Fame

Robocode's rich strategic depth exists because of dedicated community members who spent years developing, documenting,
and sharing their discoveries. This page honors those who shaped the game's competitive landscape.

## The Architects & Stewards

### Mathew A. Nelson (Mat Nelson)

The original creator of Robocode at IBM in 2001. His vision of "learning through battle" started the entire phenomenon.

### Flemming N. Larsen (fnl)

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:Fnl)  
The long-time maintainer of the classic Robocode project and the creator of **Robocode Tank Royale**. Flemming has kept
the game alive and evolving for over two decades.

### Julian Kent (Skilgannon)

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:Skilgannon)  
A legendary competitor and the current steward of the community's infrastructure. As the primary administrator of the *
*RoboWiki** and developer of the modern **LiteRumble** ranking system, he is instrumental in keeping the game's history
and competitive scene alive. He is also the author of **DrussGT**, one of the most dominant bots in history, and
perfected **Dynamic Clustering** by moving toward a "nearest neighbor" (KNN) search.

## Community Founders

### Peter Strömberg (PEZ)

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:PEZ)  
Founder and original administrator of the [RoboWiki](https://robowiki.net/). Creator of legendary bots **CassiusClay**
and **Pugilist**. PEZ was instrumental in building the collaborative community culture.

### Crippa

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:Crippa)  
Co-founder of the RoboWiki. In January 2003, Crippa and PEZ created the wiki as the community's central knowledge hub.

## The Strategy Pioneers

### David Alves

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:David_Alves)  
**Inventor of the Wave concept.** David realized that bullets travel at constant speeds, allowing for an abstract "
circle" to track exact GuessFactors. Along with Paul Evans, he co-pioneered **GuessFactor Targeting**. He also pioneered
**Pattern Matching** with Phoenix and **Random Orbital Movement** to defeat linear targeting.

### Paul Evans

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:Paul_Evans)  
Creator of **SandboxDT**. Co-pioneer of **GuessFactor Targeting**, discovering the use of "bins" (statistical buckets).
He also popularized **Segmentation**, showing that data collection should change based on variables like distance or
wall proximity.

### ABC

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:Abc)  
**Inventor of Wave Surfing**, the most significant defensive discovery in Robocode history. He also pioneered the
earliest forms of **Dynamic Clustering** and, along with **Aelryen**, developed **Minimum Risk Movement** for melee
combat.

### Patrick Cupka (Voidious)

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:Voidious)  
Author of **Dookious**. Voidious refined **Wave Surfing** and movement flattening to a science. He managed the RoboWiki
for many years starting in 2007 and wrote many of the community's definitive strategy guides.

## Bot Innovators & Algorithmic Pioneers

### Corbos, Chase-san, and Simonton

The early pioneers of **K-D Trees** in Robocode. **Corbos** was the first to mention the data structure on the RoboWiki,
sparking interest from **Chase-san** and **Simonton**. Simonton later pushed **Dynamic Clustering** to its limits with
his bot **Diamond**, proving that nearest-neighbor searches could achieve near-perfect accuracy.

### Alex Schultz (Rednaxela)

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:Rednaxela)  
Known for high-performance algorithms, Rednaxela developed the **highly optimized Java K-D Tree** implementation that
became the community standard. While not the first to introduce the structure, his work on efficiency allowed modern
bots to search massive amounts of data instantly.

### Albert Perez

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:Albert)  
Creator of the original **RoboRumble** client, the distributed ranking system that made Robocode a competitive sport. He
also pioneered **Precise Prediction**, simulating Robocode's physics perfectly to allow for ultra-accurate targeting.

### Kawigi

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:Kawigi)  
The community's "Great Educator." Kawigi wrote the definitive GuessFactor Targeting Tutorial and authored **FloodMini**,
the open-source bot that taught the community how to implement high-level targeting.

### MultiplyByZer0

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:MultiplyByZer0)  
A prolific wiki editor and contributor who documented complex wave mechanics and provided the code samples that helped
many beginners become experts.

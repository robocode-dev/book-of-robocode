# Wall of Fame

Robocode's rich strategic depth exists because of dedicated community members who spent years developing, documenting,
and sharing their discoveries. This page honors those who shaped the game's competitive landscape.

## The Pioneers

These individuals made foundational contributions to Robocode strategy and community infrastructure.

### Paul Evans (SandboxDT)

[RoboWiki - SandboxDT](https://robowiki.net/wiki/SandboxDT)

Creator of **SandboxDT** and **SandboxGT**, Paul Evans invented **GuessFactor Targeting** — the statistical targeting 
approach that revolutionized competitive Robocode. Instead of predicting enemy movement with formulas, GuessFactor 
Targeting records where enemies actually go and aims at the most probable position. This technique remains fundamental 
to advanced bot development today.

### Peter Strömberg (PEZ)

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:PEZ)

Founder, host, and administrator of the original [RoboWiki](https://robowiki.net/), the central knowledge repository 
for Robocode strategy. Creator of legendary bots **CassiusClay** and **Pugilist**. PEZ maintained the site's 
infrastructure, wrote articles, shared insights, and preserved Robocode history by maintaining a static copy of the 
old RoboWiki to ensure early knowledge wasn't lost.

Beyond technical contributions, PEZ was instrumental in building the collaborative community culture that made RoboWiki
thrive. His vision of open knowledge sharing shaped the entire Robocode community.

> [!NOTE]
> If you know who else co-founded RoboWiki with PEZ in the early days, please contribute this information via a pull 
> request or issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/robocode-dev/book-of-robocode).

### Patrick Cupka (Voidious)

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:Voidious)

Author of **Dookious**, which held the #1 ranking for an extended period. Voidious refined Wave Surfing, GuessFactor
segmentation, and movement flattening to near-perfection. His extensive tutorials and detailed explanations on RoboWiki
helped countless bot developers understand advanced concepts.

### Julian Kent (Skilgannon)

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:Skilgannon)

Author of **DrussGT**, one of the most dominant bots in Robocode history. Skilgannon advanced **Dynamic Clustering**,
**anti-surfer targeting**, and melee strategies. His work pushed the boundaries of what statistical targeting could
achieve.

Beyond bot development, Skilgannon created and maintains **[LiteRumble](https://robowiki.net/wiki/LiteRumble)**, the
modern ranking system that succeeded RoboRumble. He also hosts **[RoboWiki.net](https://robowiki.net/)**, ensuring the
community's knowledge base remains accessible.

### Albert Perez

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:Albert)

Creator of **[RoboRumble](https://robowiki.net/wiki/RoboRumble)**, the original continuous ranking system that
transformed Robocode from casual experimentation into a competitive sport. RoboRumble allowed bot authors worldwide to
compare their creations against thousands of opponents, driving rapid innovation in targeting and movement strategies.

### David Alves

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:David_Alves)

Author of **Phoenix** and **Falcon**. David contributed extensively to **pattern matching**, **precise prediction**, and
physics documentation. His analytical approach helped formalize many concepts that were previously understood only
intuitively.

## Documentation Champions

These contributors ensured that knowledge was preserved and accessible.

### MultiplyByZer0

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:MultiplyByZer0)

Active wiki editor who documented targeting strategies, wave mechanics, and provided numerous code samples. Helped
maintain and expand RoboWiki's coverage of intermediate and advanced topics.

### Kawigi

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:Kawigi)

Early contributor of movement and targeting tutorials. Kawigi's beginner-friendly explanations helped bridge the gap
between novice and intermediate bot development.

## Bot Innovators

These developers created influential bots that introduced new techniques or pushed existing ones to new heights.

### ABC

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:Abc)

Inventor of **Wave Surfing**, the defensive movement technique that revolutionized how bots evade enemy fire. Author of 
**Shadow**, which introduced innovative melee gun techniques. Shadow's approach to multi-target engagement influenced 
subsequent melee bot development. ABC was also an early contributor to RoboWiki's founding and development.

### Simonton

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:Simonton)

Author of **Diamond**, which refined Dynamic Clustering targeting to exceptional accuracy. Diamond demonstrated how
careful segmentation and statistical methods could outperform simpler approaches.

### Rednaxela

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:Rednaxela)

Implemented efficient **KD-Tree** data structures for clustering algorithms. These optimizations made advanced
statistical techniques practical for real-time bot decision-making.

## The Broader Community

Robocode's success stems from hundreds of contributors who:

- Shared bot source code and strategies openly
- Answered questions on forums and chat channels
- Ran competitions and maintained rankings
- Tested, debugged, and improved the game itself

This book draws extensively from their collective wisdom. Every technique described here was discovered, refined, or
documented by community members over two decades of collaborative development.

> "If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants."

> The same applies to competitive Robocode. Today's top bots build upon techniques pioneered by those listed here and
> many others.

## Flemming N. Larsen

Special recognition goes to **Flemming N. Larsen**, the original creator of Robocode and current maintainer of *
*Robocode Tank Royale**. Without his vision and continued dedication, none of this would exist.

# Wall of Fame

Robocode's rich strategic depth exists because of dedicated community members who spent years developing, documenting,
and sharing their discoveries. This page honors those who shaped the game's competitive landscape.

## The Architects & Stewards

### Mathew A. Nelson (Mat Nelson)

The original creator of Robocode at IBM in 2001. His vision of "learning through battle" started the entire phenomenon.

### Flemming Nørnberg Larsen (fnl)

[GitHub Profile](https://github.com/flemming-n-larsen)
[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:FlemmingLarsen)  
The long-time maintainer of the classic [Robocode project](https://robocode.sourceforge.io) and the creator of
**[Robocode Tank Royale](https://robocode.dev/)**. Flemming has kept the game alive and evolving for over two decades.

### Julian Kent (Skilgannon)

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:Skilgannon)  
A legendary competitor and the current steward of the community's infrastructure. As the primary administrator of the
**[RoboWiki](https://robowiki.net/)** and developer of the modern **[LiteRumble](https://robowiki.net/wiki/LiteRumble)**
ranking system, he keeps the game's history and competitive scene alive. He authored
**[DrussGT](https://robowiki.net/wiki/DrussGT)**, one of the
most dominant bots in history, and perfected **Dynamic Clustering** using a K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) approach.

## Community Founders

### Peter Strömberg (PEZ)

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:PEZ)  
Founder and original administrator of the [RoboWiki](https://robowiki.net/). Creator of legendary bots
**[CassiusClay](https://robowiki.net/wiki/CassiusClay)** and **[Pugilist](https://robowiki.net/wiki/Pugilist)**. Peter
was instrumental in building the collaborative community culture
that allowed Robocode to thrive.

### Crippa

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:Crippa)  
Co-founder of the RoboWiki. In January 2003, Crippa and Peter Strömberg created the wiki as a private site before
opening it to the public to serve as the community's central knowledge hub.

## The Strategy Pioneers

### David Alves

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:David_Alves)  
**Inventor of the Wave concept.** David realized that because bullets travel at constant speeds, shooters can track
exact "GuessFactors" using an expanding circle. Along with Paul Evans, he co-pioneered **GuessFactor Targeting**. He
also pioneered **Pattern Matching** with his bot **[Phoenix](https://robowiki.net/wiki/Phoenix)** and **Random Orbital
Movement**.

### Paul Evans

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:Paul_Evans)  
Creator of **[SandboxDT](https://robowiki.net/wiki/SandboxDT)**. A co-pioneer of **GuessFactor Targeting**, he
discovered the use of "bins" (statistical buckets) to track movement. He also popularized **Segmentation**, proving that
bot data should be categorized by variables like distance or wall proximity.

### Alexandros (ABC)

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:Abc)  
**Inventor of Wave Surfing**, the most significant defensive discovery in Robocode history. He also pioneered the
earliest forms of **Dynamic Clustering** and, along with **Aelryen**, developed **Minimum Risk Movement** for melee
combat. His bot **[Shadow](https://robowiki.net/wiki/Shadow)** set the standard for high-level multi-target engagement.

### Patrick Cupka (Voidious)

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:Voidious)  
Author of **[Dookious](https://robowiki.net/wiki/Dookious)**. Patrick refined **Wave Surfing** and movement flattening
to a science. He managed the RoboWiki for many years starting in 2007 and wrote many of the community's definitive
strategy guides.

### Kev (kc)

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:Kev)  
Author of **[GresSuffurd](https://robowiki.net/wiki/GresSuffurd)**. Kev represents the pinnacle of 1-vs-1 performance,
holding the current RoboRumble crown by a massive margin. His bots pushed statistical targeting and movement to their
absolute limits.

## Algorithmic & Data Innovations

### Corbos, Chase-san, and Nathaniel Simonton (Simonton)

The early pioneers of **k-D Trees** in Robocode. **[Corbos](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:Corbos)** was the first to
mention the data structure on the RoboWiki, sparking interest from
**[Chase-san](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:Chase-san)** and
**[Nathaniel Simonton](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:Simonton)**. Simonton built the first k-D tree in a bot and
pushed **Dynamic Clustering** to its limits with **[Diamond](https://robowiki.net/wiki/Diamond)**.

### Alex Schultz (Rednaxela) and Julian Kent (Skilgannon)

Alex Schultz, known for his bot **[Toad](https://robowiki.net/wiki/Toad)**, introduced advanced k-D tree pruning
strategies that sparked a performance race with Julian Kent. This collaboration and competition resulted in some
of the fastest Java and C++ k-D tree implementations in existence, including Julian's
**[Bucket-PR k-D tree](https://github.com/jkflying/bucket-pr-kdtree/blob/master/C%2B%2B/README.md)** which is now used
in several commercial products.

### Albert Perez

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:Albert)  
Creator of the original **[RoboRumble](https://robowiki.net/wiki/RoboRumble)** client and the bot
**[MicroAspid](https://robowiki.net/wiki/MicroAspid)**. He turned Robocode into a true competitive sport and pioneered
**Precise Prediction**, simulating Robocode's physics perfectly to allow for ultra-accurate targeting.

### Kyle Huntington (Kawigi)

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:Kawigi)  
The community's "Great Educator." Kyle wrote the definitive GuessFactor Targeting Tutorial and authored
**[FloodMini](https://robowiki.net/wiki/FloodMini)**, the open-source bot that taught the wider community how to
implement statistical targeting.

### MultiplyByZer0

[RoboWiki User Page](https://robowiki.net/wiki/User:MultiplyByZer0)  
A prolific wiki editor and contributor who documented complex wave mechanics and provided the code samples that helped
many beginners become experts.

This project, The Book of Robocode, builds on two decades of work by many people across Robocode and Robocode Tank
Royale.

## Primary Authors & Stewards

- **Flemming Nørnberg Larsen** — Author of *The Book of Robocode*; Robocode maintainer (2005–present); creator of
  Robocode Tank Royale.
- **Mathew A. Nelson** — Original creator of Robocode (2001–2005).
- **Julian Kent (Skilgannon)** — Current host and administrator of RoboWiki.net; creator/maintainer of the LiteRumble
  ranking system; creator of the legendary bot *DrussGT*.

## Notable Contributors

- **Pavel Savara** — Major contributions to Robocode core development (modularization, replays, refactoring, and build
  systems).
- **RoboWiki Contributors** — Decades of foundational research, mathematical analysis, and collective documentation.
- **Tournament Organizers & Bot Authors** — All those who shared their code and knowledge to advance the competitive
  state of the art.

## The RoboWiki Foundation

- **Peter Strömberg (PEZ)** — Founder, host, and original administrator of RoboWiki (2003–2007); creator of
  *CassiusClay* and *Pugilist*.
- **Crippa** — Co-founder of RoboWiki (2003).
- **Patrick Cupka (Voidious)** — Former RoboWiki manager (2007+) and author of definitive strategy guides and the bot
  *Dookious*.

## Competitive Infrastructure

- **Albert Perez** — Creator of the original **RoboRumble** distributed ranking system.
- **Julian Kent (Skilgannon)** — Creator and maintainer of **LiteRumble**, the modern standard for bot rankings.

## Pioneering Techniques

### Targeting Innovations

- **David Alves** — **Invented the Wave concept**; co-pioneer of GuessFactor Targeting; pioneered Pattern Matching (
  *Phoenix*).
- **Paul Evans** — Co-pioneer of **GuessFactor Targeting** (discovered the "bins" approach); popularized Segmentation.
- **ABC** — Pioneered the earliest forms of **Dynamic Clustering** (later refined into modern KNN approaches).
- **Julian Kent (Skilgannon)** — Perfected Dynamic Clustering using the **K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)** approach.
- **Kawigi** — Author of the definitive GuessFactor Targeting tutorial and the *FloodMini* bot, which educated
  generations of coders.

### Movement Innovations

- **ABC** — **Invented Wave Surfing**, the most significant defensive discovery in Robocode; co-pioneered Minimum Risk
  Movement.
- **David Alves** — Pioneered Random Orbital Movement to counter linear and circular targeting.
- **Patrick Cupka (Voidious)** — Refined Wave Surfing and movement flattening into a precise science.

### Structural & Algorithmic Innovations

- **Albert Perez** — Pioneered **Precise Prediction**, providing the physics simulation necessary for high-level
  movement prediction.
- **Corbos** — The first to mention **K-D Trees** on the RoboWiki, initiating the community's move toward efficient data
  structures.
- **Chase-san & Simonton** — Early explorers and pioneers of K-D tree implementations; Simonton's bot *Diamond* pushed
  these structures to their competitive limits.
- **Alex Schultz (Rednaxela)** — Developed the **highly optimized Java K-D tree implementation** that became the gold
  standard for modern Dynamic Clustering.
